# Multibrand profiles app

The Multibrand profiles app is a Zendesk App that allows agents to view, create & update Sunshine user profiles related to a brand. By default, the app displays the user profile associated with the ticket's brand. If it doesn't exist, the agent can create a new profile for this user, or switch brands on the ticket to see the other profiles.
